# Satellite Tracker: MVVM + Coroutine + Flow = ðŸ¦¾

Hi there, Satellite app is a sample test project
in this project I used MVVM + Clean Architecture fully modular based. I Used navigation component for implementing single activity
and easy to maintain fragments and feature. I used Moshi for parse initial data form assets folder to 
cache them on database with Room. Also I used Kotlin and Flow to make coroutine able to get the data flow in it's hand. Also I 
created a custom workaround to manage app and modules dependencies. Created master view design in tablet mode. Satellites Tracker
is Compatible with Android M and above.
