# Satellite Tracker: MVVM + Coroutine + Flow = ðŸ¦¾

Hi there

In this project I created a fully modular app with MVVM and Clean Architecture. Used navigation component for implementing single activity
and decreasing the features dependencies through Deeplink. Used Moshi for parsing the initial data form assets folder to 
cache them on database with Room. Also with help of Flow I let coroutine get the data flow in hand. Also I 
created a custom workaround to manage modules dependencies. Created master view design for tablets. 

Satellites Tracker is Compatible with Android M and above.
